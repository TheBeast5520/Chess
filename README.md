# Chess

#### Description

A 2-player Chess Code in Python.

#### How to use

You will need the python code, Chess.py, and the folder (with its contests), backgrounds, in the same directory.

Libraries needed: pillow, tkinter

tkinter usually comes with python, but you may have to install pillow.

Click on a piece and then where you want to move it. If it is a valid move, the code will allow it.
